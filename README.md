* App Summary:
    Tank Temps allows brewers to get live readings of fermentation tank temperatures. In the app, once logged in, the brewers can set a target temperature that matches the set temperature on the thermostat. If the temperature rises or drops two degrees above or below the target temp a notification will be sent out to anyone who is currently logged in. Having this technology will allow brewers to be notified as soon as something goes wrong, giving them time to fix the situation before losing an entire tank of beer.
